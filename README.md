# UnsupervisedMachineLearning

## Repository Description

The present repository aims on appliyng the most used Machine Learning algorithms combined.

  The [KMEANSandMCA](https://github.com/Andrercouto/UnsupervisedMachineLearning/blob/main/KMEANSandMCA.ipynb) notebook describes the application of the K-means Clustering method combined to a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. The Clustering algorithm is initially applied to the numerical variables of the dataset, so that the outputs obtained will serve as input for the application of the MCA (that calculates the coordinates of the categories) and the plotting of the Perceptual Map of the categories contained in the variables (where that the closest categories in the perceptual map have a stronger association with each other).
  
 The notebook [MCAandPCA](https://github.com/Andrercouto/UnsupervisedMachineLearning/blob/main/MCAandPCA.ipynb) aims to create a ranking using Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Principal Component Analysis combined. The data set covered concerns a set of houses, containing their categorical and numerical characteristics. MCA is applied to take the coordinates of the categorical variables and combine them with the numeric variables, and then PCA is applied to find the principal components of the set. Finally, the ranking is calculated based on the main components and their variances.
 
 [PCAandAGGHIERCUSTERING](https://github.com/Andrercouto/UnsupervisedMachineLearning/blob/main/PCAandAGGHIERCUSTERING.ipynb) focuses on the use of Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction and on the application of Agglomerative Hierarchy Clustering to group similar observations considering a group of countries.
